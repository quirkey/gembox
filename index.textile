!Gembox.jpg!


h3(#what). What

Gembox is a very simple web based application for browsing your local ruby gems. It uses "Sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com to provide a pretty layer on your gem repository, so you can browse, find, and learn about your installed ruby gems.

h3(#why). Why

I'm currently obsessed with the idea that Sinatra can be used as a web interface for existing Ruby projects. What better Ruby project to prove it with then the omega-project, Rubygems.

h3(#usage). Usage

Once gembox is installed its very simple to start it up.

{% highlight bash %}
$ gembox
{% endhighlight %}

If all goes well, this will start gembox at:

"http://localhost:5678":http://localhost:5678

h4. Installing With Passenger Pane

To use Gembox with Passenger Pane there are a few simple steps you need to do:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone git://github.com/quirkey/gembox.git
$ open ./gembox/
{% endhighlight %}

Then open up Passenger Pane and drag the open Gembox folder into the list on the left (You'll have to be authenticated). Now browse to http://gembox.local/ and you'll see gembox! I told you it was simple.

h3(#features). Features

At this point the features are pretty limited. You get:

* some basic stats
* search for gem by name
* some views of all your installed gems
* RDoc!
* ability to browse by version
* see a pretty gemspec
* browse the included files
* jump to the file in github (if the gem's homepage == github)

Some features that I'd like to do (or you can with a simple 'fork you'):

* make this a full on gem server
* install gems in the browser
* better support for github linkage
* easy daemonizing + running on a named local host like: http://localgems

Another enterprising soul has done the work of converting gem server to a sinatra app:

"http://github.com/jnewland/sinatra-rubygems/tree/master":http://github.com/jnewland/sinatra-rubygems/tree/master
