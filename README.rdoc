= gembox

== DESCRIPTION:

Gembox is a little sinatra app that ties in with your local ruby gems to let you browse and learn more about them.

Please see the project home page for a full description:

http://code.quirkey.com/gembox

=== USAGE:

==== BASIC:

Install gembox:

  sudo gem install gembox
  
On the command-line:
  
  $ gembox
  
And it should launch gembox in your browser.

==== WITH PASSENGER:

To use Gembox with Passenger Pane there are a few simple steps you need to do:

 $ git clone git://github.com/quirkey/gembox.git
 $ open ./gembox/

Then open up Passenger Pane and drag the open Gembox folder into the list on the left (You'll have to be authenticated). Now browse to http://gembox.local/ and you'll see gembox! I told you it was simple.

=== HACKING:

To run the test suite, check that you have the dependencies installed:

  $ rake check_dependencies

Then run <tt>rake test</tt>.
